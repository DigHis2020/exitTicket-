This class has been a tremendous learning experience for me. 
My growth as a digital historian, and as a user of technology has been undeniable over the last six weeks. 
As a digital historian, I have learned about exciting resources that can help me to model historical data and find its significance. 
This is exciting to me because these are the tools that are going to advance the discipline in upcoming years and change how we study our histories. 
I have also become much more confident and comfortable with using digital resources in my studies. 
The exercises in this course have allowed me to develop my digital literacy to a point where I feel capable of navigating technical instructions, properly asking for help, and using basic tools without feeling overwhelmed.
I even developed a new interest in the sonification of history and other digital representations of history that we explored in week five.
This is a big accomplishment for me, given my absolute novice status in digital history prior to the beginning of this term. 
In general, my resilience in the face of technical failure has benefitted. More often than not in this class, I experienced failure to some degree during an exercise. 
I had to adapt to struggling with the programs, vocabulary, etc. and it was because of this that I matured as a student. 
The concept of failing gloriously which you discussed in week one was certainly relatable. Throughout the class, I was limited by my tech skills in how far I could really go without getting lost and confused. 
However, by struggling through this and applying my best efforts I honed my troubleshooting skills and my patience, amongst the other things which Iâ€™ve already mentioned.
